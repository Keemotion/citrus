                          Parsing Expressions for Ruby


Citrus is a compact and powerful parsing library for Ruby that combines the
elegance and expressiveness of the language with the simplicity and power of
parsing expression grammars.

Citrus grammars look very much like Treetop grammars but take a completely
different approach. Instead of generating parsers from your grammars, Citrus
evaluates grammars and rules in memory as Ruby modules. In fact, you can even
define your grammars as Ruby modules in the first place, entirely skipping the
parsing/evaluation step.

Terminals are represented as either strings or regular expressions. Support for
sequences, choices, labels, repetition, and lookahead (both positive and
negative) are all included, as well as character classes and the dot-matches-
anything symbol.

To try it out, fire up an IRB session from the root of the project and run one
of the examples.

    $ irb -Ilib
    > require 'citrus'
     => true
    > Citrus.load 'examples/calc'
     => [Calc]
    > match = Calc.parse '1 + 5'
     => #<Citrus::Match ...
    > match.value
     => 6

Be sure to try requiring `citrus/debug' (instead of just `citrus') if you'd like
some better visualization of the match results.

The code base is very small and it's well-documented and tested, so it should be
fairly easy to understand for anyone who is familiar with parsing expressions.
